## 📖 Overview

VendorBridge is a modern Procurement & Vendor Management ERP platform designed to digitize and automate the complete procurement lifecycle of organizations.

The system enables procurement teams, vendors, managers, and administrators to collaborate through a centralized platform for managing vendors, RFQs, quotations, approvals, purchase orders, invoices, procurement analytics, and activity tracking.

VendorBridge eliminates manual procurement processes and improves operational efficiency through workflow automation and role-based access control.
